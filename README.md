# Continual Learning for Anomaly based Network Intrusion Detection

These are the experiments we have done on network datasets for different Continual learning algorithms. We have tested the algorithms on 3 datasets i.e ids17, ids18, kddcup99. The code files are present in their respective folders. In each sub folder readme is written on how to run the files
