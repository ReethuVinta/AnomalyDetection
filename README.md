# On the Suitability of Continual Learning for Anomaly based Network Intrusion Detection

These are the experiments we have done on network datasets for different Continual learning algorithms. We have tested the algorithms on 3 datasets i.e ids17,ids18,kddcup99. The code files are present in their respective folders. In each sub folder readme is written on how to run the files
