# Using Avalanche API 

- Follow the instructions to download CICIDS17 dataset from kaggle from the [README](../README.md) file in root directory.
- Follow the avalanche API installation instructions from the [website](https://avalanche.continualai.org/getting-started/how-to-install#installing-avalanche-with-pip). Its preferable to create a new python/conda environment for instaling.  

- Activate the new env and run   ```$ bash python avalanche_ids.py``` for results and logs
- For 0/1 classification run ```$ bash python ids_01_classification.py``` for results and logs
